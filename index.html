    <p style="text-align: justify;">
Helpera is a Residential Assistance Booking Platform that simplifies securing technical services like plumbing, electrical work, and gardening. It offers two booking types: scheduled for planned tasks and urgent for immediate needs. The platformâ€™s user-friendly interface allows residents to browse services, view helper profiles with ratings and expertise, and book assistance easily. Once a request is made, the system matches it with the most suitable helper, ensuring efficiency. Real-time updates keep residents informed of their request status and helper arrival.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
Helpera also supports flexible booking management for helpers, allowing them to handle one scheduled and one urgent task simultaneously. The end-to-end cancellation process ensures fairness by giving helpers the option to approve or decline cancellations for accepted tasks. Residents can provide feedback and ratings to maintain service quality. Admins can oversee bookings, assign tasks, and reassign requests if needed.

The Inventory Management System for LionsTech CycleShop is designed to streamline and simplify the entire shopping and inventory process for both buyers and staff. Buyers can place orders for various cycling products through the system, specifying items for pick-up only, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free shopping experience. Once a buyer places an order, the system seamlessly notifies the cashier, who can review, prepare, and approve the order before notifying the buyer when it is ready for pick-up. This process ensures efficient handling of orders and minimizes wait times. The system also stores detailed buyer contact information, making it easy for cashiers to send notifications or updates regarding order status, enhancing customer satisfaction and communication.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
On the backend, the system excels at inventory management by keeping accurate records of available products and automatically updating stock levels as orders are processed. If inventory levels fall below a predefined threshold, the system notifies staff and provides the necessary supplier contact information, ensuring timely restocking and preventing shortages. Additionally, comprehensive sales reports are generated to give insights into sales performance, trends, and revenue, helping staff make informed decisions about inventory and sales strategies. This feature-rich system supports the smooth operation of LionsTech CycleShop, improving efficiency, customer communication, and inventory control, while ensuring that the shop remains well-stocked and responsive to buyer needs.

This mobile application is designed to translate sign language into text, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. The app utilizes MediaPipe's gesture recognition to identify key points of the user's hand movements. By capturing these points, the app can interpret the gestures used in sign language and convert them into corresponding text. This innovative approach allows for real-time translation, providing a seamless way for users to communicate using sign language.
    </p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">
The app's core strength lies in its custom processing system, which goes beyond simple gesture recognition. It allows for movements and signs to be processed and trained in real-time with minimal effort. Users can easily train the app to recognize specific words or phrases, making it adaptable to various sign language dialects and personal signing styles. This flexibility ensures that the app can continuously learn and improve, offering a more personalized and accurate translation experience over time.

        This thesis explores the design and development of an augmented reality (AR) application aimed at enhancing young childrenâ€™s engagement with traditional storybooks. Targeting an audience of children between the ages of 3 to 5, the study addresses a contemporary challenge: how traditional printed books, limited by static illustrations, compete with the immersive and dynamic experiences offered by modern digital media. The research proposes that AR technology can effectively bridge this gap by transforming conventional storytelling into an interactive, multisensory experience, ultimately promoting a deeper interest in reading and fostering early literacy skills.

The OMR and OCR Scanner is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of grading examinations and recognizing handwritten text. Using trained artificial intelligence (AI), the scanner can accurately detect and interpret markings on answer sheets, making it ideal for optical mark recognition (OMR). This technology helps automate the evaluation process, saving time and reducing human error in grading multiple-choice exams.
    </p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to OMR, the scanner also features optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities for handwritten text. The AI is trained to recognize various handwriting styles, allowing it to accurately convert handwritten characters into digital text. This feature is particularly useful for digitizing handwritten notes, forms, and essays, making the information easily searchable and editable. The combination of OMR and OCR functionalities makes this scanner a versatile solution for educational institutions and organizations that handle large volumes of written data.
